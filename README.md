### <h3 align="left">Inspiration</h3>
By providing personalized recommendations based on analysis of user reviews, the system can help users discover new and interesting beers that they might not have otherwise considered. At the same time, by identifying common words and themes in the reviews, the system can provide valuable insights into the factors that are most important to users when choosing a beer.

These insights could be used by breweries and other stakeholders in the beer industry to better understand and meet the needs and preferences of their customers, which in turn could lead to more informed product development and marketing efforts.

This sytem is a flask responsive web application. The user has to input his or her favourite beer and will get few beers which is most likley similar in taste. The system's interface is built using using HTML & CSS from scratch. Here we use singular value decomposition (SVD) and cosine similarity model to predict similar beers. Moreover, by entering the name of beer user can see top 5 common words in beer reviews.
